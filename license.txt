Commentary on License Choice
================================================================================

Though I see the appeal of copy-left licensing, I've decided to release all code
under the more permissive MIT license. The upshot is enjoy the code, modify it,
include in proprietary software, relicense it, etc. The only things I ask are:

- Don't hold me liable for any damages resulting from using my code
(e.g. if the code turns you to drinking heavily, don't charge the drinks
to my tab).

- If you do decide to credit people and you use my code, a thank you in the
same section as other third-party contributors would be great, but not
required!

- Finally, don't use my name to promote the sale of your product without
asking. It's great if you sell a product with my code in it, and I hope
you are wildly successful! I just don't want my name associated with a
company that acts like a jerk. So ask first.

Finally, the code may contain third party libaries. I've done my best to adhere
to their licensing rules and make them explicit. But please do your own due
diligence and double check before assuming everything is as permissive as
my own code's license!

license below is the basic MIT plus the MIT X11 and MIT XFree86 Project clauses:
